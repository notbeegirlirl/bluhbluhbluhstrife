[Characters]
 ;How to add characters
 ;---------------------
 ;Use the format:
 ;    charname, stagefilename1, stagefilename2, ...
 ;
 ;e.g. For a player with filename "kfm", and stage filename
 ;"stages/mybg.def" type (without the semicolon):
 ;    kfm, stages/mybg.def
 ;IKEMEN feature: There can be more than 1 stage assigned to character. In such
 ;case stage will be chosen randomly.
 ;
 ;If you want to load a different def file, you can enter it as a directory plus
 ;the def file. This example loads chars/kfm/alt-kfm.def:
 ;    kfm/alt-kfm.def, stages/mybg.def
 ;
 ;If you put "random" as the stagefilename, then a random stage will be selected
 ;for that player. e.g.
 ;    kfm, random
 ;IKEMEN feature: Not really needed since no stage = random anyway.
 ;
 ;Optional parameters should follow on the same line, separated by commas.
 ;Each parameter has the form:
 ;    paramname = paramvalue
 ;where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and paramvalue is the value
 ;(data) that should be assigned to that parameter.
 ;'rivals' and 'slot' parameters are the exceptions to these general rules.
 ;
 ;The optional parameters are:
 ;
 ; - music
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be used at the start
 ;   of round when facing this character. Music volume, loopstart and loopend
 ;   values can follow, separated by spaces. paramvalue overrides stage DEF
 ;   bgmusic assignment, so you can re-use the same stage with unique music for
 ;   multiple characters.
 ;   IKEMEN feature: You can use multiple music parameters for random selection.
 ;
 ; - musicalt
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used after the first round (or during deciding or final round, depending
 ;   on stage DEF file settings) when facing this character. Music volume,
 ;   loopstart and loopend values can follow, separated by spaces. paramvalue
 ;   overrides stage DEF bgmusic.alt assignment. You can use multiple musicalt
 ;   parameters for random selection.
 ;
 ; - musiclife
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used when player's controlled character has (by default) less then 30% life
 ;   during deciding round (only affects side that is at risk of being defeated)
 ;   when facing this character. Further adjustments available via stage DEF
 ;   file. Music volume, loopstart and loopend values can follow, separated by
 ;   spaces. paramvalue overrides stage DEF bgmusic.life assignment. You can use
 ;   multiple musiclife parameters for random selection.
 ;
 ; - musicvictory
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should kick
 ;   in right after this character scores final round K.O. and continue
 ;   throughout the victory screen. Music volume, loopstart and loopend values
 ;   can follow, separated by spaces. paramvalue overrides stage DEF
 ;   bgmusic.victory assignment. You can use multiple musicvictory parameters
 ;   for random selection.
 ;
 ; - ai
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue between 1 and 8 to force AI Level
 ;   regardless of difficulty and AI ramping settings.
 ;
 ; - vsscreen
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying versus screen
 ;   for this character.
 ;
 ; - winscreen
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying victory screen
 ;   after beating this character.
 ;
 ; - rounds
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the number of rounds in order to
 ;   overwrite rounds number chosen in the settings.
 ;
 ; - time
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the time (in seconds) in order to
 ;   overwrite round time chosen in the settings.
 ;
 ; - onlyme
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to force facing this character
 ;   individually in team modes.
 ;
 ; - includestage
 ;   Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid including this stage in the stage select
 ;   list (in VS, training modes, etc). The stage is also blocked from being
 ;   randomly selected for a match.
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Setting paramvalue to -1 prevents stage from being randomly
 ;   selected for a match, while still allowing you to choose it from the stage
 ;   select list.
 ;
 ; - boss
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this character in "Boss
 ;   Rush" mode.
 ;
 ; - bonus
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this character in "Bonus
 ;   Games" mode.
 ;
 ; - exclude
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to avoid including this character
 ;   in 'rows' and 'columns' screenpack selection grid. (similar result as
 ;   hiding unselectable AI only characters in mugen without need to create tons
 ;   of unnecessary select.def slots to do so). Excluded characters are not
 ;   added to randomselect pool and won't show up in VS 100 Kumite mode.
 ;
 ; - hidden
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to hide a character:
 ;   1: cursor can move to this cell, cursor, face and face background are not
 ;      rendered (same result as hiding selectable characters in mugen by
 ;      placing them outside visible grid, but without need to create lots of
 ;      unnecessary select.def slots to do so),
 ;   2: cell can't be selected, art is not rendered (slot is ignored until
 ;      character is unlocked).
 ;   3: cell behaves like randomselect slot until character is unlocked.
 ;   TODO: Unlocking hidden characters is handled via [UnlockContent] section.
 ;
 ; - order
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the character in
 ;   Arcade and Time Attack modes. A smaller value means you will fight the
 ;   character sooner (excluding 'ratio' Arcade mode, which allows more ordering
 ;   flexibility via 'arcade.ratiomatches' setting). The default order value is
 ;   1, if you omit this param. Edit *.maxmatches settings under [Options] to
 ;   customize amount of matches per order priority.
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders mugen limitation is lifted.
 ;
 ; - ordersurvival
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
 ;   character in survival mode. The default order value is 1, if you omit this
 ;   param. It works like 'order' parameter, just for different game modes
 ;   (survival / survival co-op / netplay survival co-op). To exclude character
 ;   from showing up in survival modes you can set it to order group outside
 ;   configured survival.maxmatches range (e.g. ordersurvival=0).
 ;
 ; - <number> = {} (rivals)
 ;   IKEMEN feature: The parameter alters standard arcade order system and other
 ;   default match settings, allowing to force pre-defined matches along the
 ;   way. paramname refers to arcade match number (for example 4 = 4th match).
 ;   paramvalue, enclosed in {} brackets, follows the same syntax as adding a
 ;   new character with optional stage assignment and accepts following optional
 ;   char parameters: music, musicalt, musiclife, musicvictory, ai, vsscreen,
 ;   winscreen, rounds, time, onlyme. If 'onlyme' parameter is not set and
 ;   you're playing in team mode the referenced character becomes the opposite
 ;   team leader, and other characters follows order settings. Characters and
 ;   stages referenced here, if not already added as separate entries, won't be
 ;   selectable in select screen.
 ;
 ; - maxmatches
 ;   IKEMEN feature: This parameter makes the character ignore default
 ;   *.maxmatches / *.ratiomatches settings under [Options] section and assign
 ;   different ones instead. paramvalue is used as a prefix to the original
 ;   names of these settings, followed by dot, so the new entries added under
 ;   [Options] section should look like this: 'paramvalue.arcade.maxmatches'
 ;   'paramvalue.arcade.ratiomatches' and so forth.
 ;
 ; - slot = {} (multiple chars in one slot)
 ;   IKEMEN feature: This parameter allows to assign multiple characters into a
 ;   single select screen slot. paramvalue, enclosed in {} brackets, consists
 ;   of multiple newlines, where each of them follows the usual syntax.
 ;   Characters added this way can have 3 extra parameters assigned:
 ;   - select: Set the paramvalue to the command that selects this character.
 ;     If multiple chars in this slot have the same paramvalue assigned, they
 ;     will be selected randomly.
 ;   - next: Set the paramvalue to the command that swaps the current slot
 ;     character with the next character that shares the same paramvalue.
 ;   - previous: Set the paramvalue to the command that swaps the current slot
 ;     character with the previous character that shares the same paramvalue.
 ;   Commands use the same syntax as mugen CMD files (comma is permitted)
 ;
 ;You can also add a randomize icon to the select screen. To do this, put the
 ;word "randomselect" on a line of its own, with no extra parameters.
 ;
 ;Examples:
 ; kfm, stages/mybg.def, includestage=0
 ; kfm, stages/mybg.def, maxmatches=somename
 ; kfm, stages/mybg.def, 3={SuaveDude, stages/mybg2.def}
 ; kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, order=3, ai=8, hidden=2
 ; slot = {
 ;      kfm, stages/mybg.def, previous=d, next=w
 ;      SuaveDude, previous=d, next=w, select=/s+a
 ; }

[ExtraStages]
 ;Put extra stages here. They will be available in VS and Watch modes.
 ;For example, you can insert "stages/mybg.def".
 ;
 ;Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated by commas.
 ;Each parameter has the form:
 ;    paramname = paramvalue
 ;where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and paramvalue is the value
 ;to assign that parameter. The optional parameters are:
 ;
 ; - music
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used at the start of round. Music volume, loopstart and loopend values can
 ;   follow, separated by spaces. Tracks will be played randomly from the
 ;   available pool if multiple parameters have been assigned or bgmusic is
 ;   present in the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - musicalt
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used after the first round (or during deciding or final round, depending
 ;   on stage DEF file settings). Music volume, loopstart and loopend values can
 ;   follow, separated by spaces. Tracks will be played randomly from the
 ;   available pool if multiple parameters have been assigned or bgmusic.alt
 ;   is present in the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - musiclife
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used when player's controlled character has (by default) less then 30% life
 ;   during deciding round (only affects side that is at risk of being
 ;   defeated). Further adjustments available via stage DEF file. Music volume,
 ;   loopstart and loopend values can follow, separated by spaces.  Tracks will
 ;   be played randomly from the available pool if multiple parameters have been
 ;   assigned or bgmusic.life is present in the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - musicvictory
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should kick
 ;   in right after the final round K.O. and continue throughout the victory
 ;   screen. Music volume, loopstart and loopend frame values can follow,
 ;   separated by spaces. Tracks will be played randomly from the available pool
 ;   if multiple parameters have been assigned or bgmusic.victory is present in
 ;   the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - order
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
 ;   stage in arcade modes. If there is at least 1 stage with assigned order,
 ;   facing opponent with the exact order paramvalue will result in stage being
 ;   randomly chosen from a pool of stages with the matching order.
 ;
 ;Examples:
 ; stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, music=sound/song2.mp3
 ; stages/mybg.def, order=3
 ;
 ;Insert your stages below.

;stages/egbert.def
stages/strider.def
stages/lalonde.def
;stages/harleyA.def
stages/harleyB.def
stages/skaia.def
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in arcade
 ;mode. The first number is the number of matches against characters with
 ;order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively. For example, for 4,3,1
 ;you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked characters who have order=1, followed
 ;by 3 with order=2 and 1 with order=3.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders mugen limitation is lifted.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Characters can use individual maxmatches settings (see
 ;'maxmatches' parameter in [Characters] section)

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Arcade single mode.
arcade.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Arcade team modes (sans 'Ratio').
team.maxmatches = 4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Time Attack mode.
timeattack.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: Similar to arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Survival mode.
 ;Use -1 value to choose which order number should have unlimited matches.
 ;By omitting -1 survival mode will end after particular amount of matches set
 ;below (in such case you can actually "complete" the mode).
survival.maxmatches = -1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: A 'Ratio' mode allows each team to select up to 3 characters
 ;and distribute 4 "ratio levels" amongst them, affecting their life and damage
 ;(ratio 2 is the default to which other ratios are compared, percentages are
 ;adjustable in options screen).
 ;Arcade ratio matches use 'ratiomatches' configuration instead of 'maxmatches'
 ;settings. Each entry here, separated by commas, represents a single match and
 ;consists of 2 assignments, separated by colon. Assignment on the left side of
 ;colon refers to the number of characters you will face in this match (valid
 ;numbers from 1 to 3, or a random selection range, consisting of one number,
 ;followed by a dash and another number). Assignment written after colon refers
 ;to character's order param, that can be used to limit which characters should
 ;be randomly chosen for this match. For example 2-3:4 entry means a match
 ;against team of 2 or 3 characters, chosen from characters with order=4.
arcade.ratiomatches = 1-3:1, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1, 1-2:3

 ;AI ramping
 ;IKEMEN feature: AI ramping settings has been moved here from mugen.cfg
 ;You can view AI ramping output for all battles from the last chosen mode via
 ;debug/t_aiRamp.txt (useful reference also for vanilla mugen).

 ;Arcade / Time Attack single mode AI ramping
 ;For both parameters below, the first number corresponds to the number of
 ;matches won, and the second number to the AI difficulty offset. The actual
 ;difficulty is the sum of the AI difficulty level (set in the options menu) and
 ;the value of the offset at a particular match.
 ;  AIramp.start = start_match, start_diff
 ;  AIramp.end   = end_match, end_diff
 ;The difficulty offset function is a constant value of start_diff from the
 ;first match until start_match matches have been won. From then the offset
 ;value increases linearly from start_diff to end_diff. After end_diff matches
 ;have been won, the offset value is end_diff.
 ;  e_d            /----------
 ;               /
 ;  s_d _______/
 ;     ^      ^     ^        ^
 ;   1st_m   s_m   e_m     last_m
 ;For example, if you have:
 ;  AIramp.start = 2,0
 ;  AIramp.end   = 4,2
 ;For 6 matches at level 4, the difficulty will be (by match):
 ;  4,4,4,5,6,6

arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack team modes AI ramping (sans 'Ratio')
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack 'Ratio' mode AI ramping
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

ratio.AIramp.start = 1, 0
ratio.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Survival Mode AI ramping
 ;For 16 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8

survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4
