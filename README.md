ok look im gonna try porting strife project. thats okay right? ok cool
anyways um
theres probably gonna be like one or two changes in the files. one sadly includes the june name port. even though i am the biggest june egbert believer there is no reason to have an optional patch included in a web port of a game
if you want to play as june then thats just better encouragement to support the regular strife project devs
im also gonna try maybe cutting out one or two files. rough decision but maybe just the completely optional mac and linux ports that are included in the files. i mean it kinda makes sense but not for a web port!! ok um
fuck how do i do this
